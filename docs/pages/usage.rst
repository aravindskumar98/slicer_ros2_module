=============================
Using the Slicer ROS 2 module
=============================

You should leave the first two drop-down menus as-is, i.e.
``State`` should be ``tf2`` and ``Description`` should be ``parameter``.

The defaults ``/robot_state_publisher`` and ``robot_description`` should work
for most cases so leave these as-is too.

To activate your selection, just hit "Enter" in the ``/robot_state_publisher`` box.
Please note that we plan to improve this user interface.

At that point, the robot's model should be loaded and displayed in Slicer.
